nwtool cmdline program.

similar options for serial and USB support - Implemented by function
pointers (init functions return a struct nwtool_ops).

Serial stuff is pretty straight forward as the protocol is so limited,
but it also has to support a special mode to create an input device
using uinput.

USB first of all needs to detach the configuration interface of the
USB device from the HID driver, so userspace/libhid can access it.

Usage:

nwtool [-u|-s <device>] [-i] [-r <ms>] [-d <ms>] [-D <value>] [-m <mode>]
        [-b <ms>] [-t <value>] [-k <value>] [-p <nr>] [-f] [-c]

-u|--usb   	   	  access touchscreen over USB
-s|--serial <device>	  access touchscreen over serial <device>
-i|--info   	  	  display info and current settings
-r|--rightclick	  	  set rightclick delay to <ms>
-d|--doubleclick  	  set doubleclick time to <ms>
-D|--drag-threshold	  set drag threshold to <value>
-m|--report-mode	  set reporting mode to <mode>
-b|--buzzer-time	  set buzzer time to <ms>
-t|--buzzer-tone	  set buzzer tone to <value>
-k|--calibration-key	  set calibration key to <value>
-p|--calibration-presses  set nr of calibration presses to <nr>
-f|--forward		  forward touchscreen events to kernel
-c|--calibrate		  put touchscreen in calibration mode
