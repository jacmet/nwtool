nwtool cmdline program.

similar options for serial and USB support - Implemented by function
pointers (init functions return a struct nwtool_ops).

Serial stuff is pretty straight forward as the protocol is so limited,
but it also has to support a special mode to create an input device
using uinput.

USB first of all needs to detach the configuration interface of the
USB device from the HID driver, so userspace/libhid can access it.
